## Why Recategorization is Needed

**Current Issue:** Corporate networks block "Uncategorized" sites by default as a security policy. This prevents legitimate professional use of wellbeing and personal development resources.

**Impact:** Employees interested in mental health, personal development, and AI-assisted reflection tools cannot access this legitimate service during work hours, similar to how meditation apps or therapy platforms might be accessed during breaks.

**Correct Categorization:** As a technology platform focused on digital wellbeing, this site belongs in the same category as:
- Meditation and mindfulness apps
- AI-assisted productivity tools
- Personal development platforms
- Digital health and wellness services

---

## Content Summary

The site contains:

1. **Homepage:** Introduction to the technology and its purpose
2. **Sacred Texts:** Philosophical discussions about technology ethics and consciousness (similar to blog posts about tech philosophy)
3. **Educational Content:** Information about Jungian psychology and reflection practices

All content is:
- Original and professionally written
- Free of malware, phishing, or malicious code
- Appropriate for workplace access (similar to Medium articles or TED talks)
- Educational and informative in nature
