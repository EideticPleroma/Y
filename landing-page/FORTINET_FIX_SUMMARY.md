## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Professional Security Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

File: `landing-page/public/.htaccess`

All professional security headers now active via Apache configuration:
- âœ… `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (prevents MIME sniffing)
- âœ… `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevents clickjacking)
- âœ… `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` (XSS protection)
- âœ… `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (privacy)
- âœ… `Content-Security-Policy` (comprehensive content policy)
- âœ… `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS enforcement)

#### 2. Standard Web Infrastructure
- âœ… `robots.txt` - Proper search engine directives
- âœ… `sitemap.xml` - All pages indexed for search engines
- âœ… `.well-known/security.txt` - RFC 9116 security contact info

#### 3. Metadata Refinement
File: `landing-page/src/app/layout.tsx`

Updated keywords to emphasize legitimate business use:
```typescript
keywords: "AI technology, digital reflection, self-improvement, personal development, 
          consciousness, psychology, Jungian, wellbeing technology"
```

Added classification hint:
```typescript
other: {
  'classification': 'Technology/Health and Wellness',
}
```

#### 4. Recategorization Request Documentation
File: `landing-page/FORTIGUARD_RECATEGORIZATION_REQUEST.md`

Complete professional request document prepared with:
- Business justification

## Technical Notes

### Why .htaccess?
Next.js static export doesn't support runtime headers, so we use Apache's `.htaccess` to set security headers on the server side.

### Why Not HTTPS?
Current hosting is HTTP-only. HSTS header is included for future HTTPS upgrade, but won't cause issues on HTTP.

### Metadata Balance
Keywords carefully balanced:
- Business-friendly: "AI technology," "personal development"
- Still authentic: "consciousness," "Jungian," "wellbeing"
- Not compromised: Sacred technology essence preserved
