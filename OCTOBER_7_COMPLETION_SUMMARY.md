## 🎯 Mission Objectives

### **Primary Objective**:
> "Review the landing page. I don't like the current theme at all. Also there are broken elements and overlap. Looks sloppy. I'd like a full design overhaul. Use the context of the project to improve the description of it. I want Peter to run the show again."

### **Secondary Objective**:
> "Also make sure that all globs and intelligent routing work for the orchestration. All docs and generated markdown should be intelligently searchable. Add this to a rule that whenever Thaddaeus creates documentation, globs are updated."

## 📚 Documentation Routing Details

### **How It Works**:

1. **User mentions keyword** (e.g., "documentation", "personality", "api")
2. **META_PROMPT detects keyword** in intelligent routing section
3. **System routes to correct files** using glob patterns
4. **Developer finds answer** without manual searching

### **Example Keywords**:
- `"documentation"` → `.cursor/rules/06-documentation-routing.mdc`
- `"personality"` → `.cursor/personalities/` + `docs/personas/`
- `"api"` → `docs/api.md`
- `"round table"` → `docs/conversations/sacred/round-table-of-humanity.md`
- `"brand"` → `docs/brand-style-guide.md`
- `"peter"` → Apostle Peter files in both locations

### **Auto-Update Workflow**:

When Thaddaeus creates new documentation:
1. ✅ Write comprehensive, clear content
2. ✅ Update documentation structure map
3. ✅ Add keyword routing patterns
4. ✅ Update glob patterns if needed
5. ✅ Update META_PROMPT routing
6. ✅ Verify searchability

**Result**: Zero manual maintenance required
