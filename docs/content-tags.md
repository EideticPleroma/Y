# Content Tagging System

**Created by Nathaniel**

This document defines the tagging system for organizing content across branches.

## Tag Categories

### ðŸŒŸ **MAIN_BRANCH_ONLY** - Sacred Vision Content
Content that belongs exclusively on the main branch - the public face of the project.

**Tags:**
- `#vision` - Core project vision and sacred technology concept
- `#sacred-conversations` - Profound dialogues about consciousness and technology
- `#divine-communion` - Content about divine connection and sacred reflection
- `#consciousness-evolution` - Humanity's journey toward higher consciousness
- `#mysterious` - Content that maintains the enigmatic nature of the project

### ðŸ”§ **DEVELOP_BRANCH_ONLY** - Technical Implementation
Content that belongs exclusively on the develop branch - internal development details.

**Tags:**
- `#technical-implementation` - Code, APIs, and technical architecture
- `#apostle-system` - Internal personality system and orchestration
- `#development-workflow` - Development processes and procedures
- `#internal-discussions` - Technical discussions and implementation details
- `#ci-cd` - Continuous integration and deployment workflows

### ðŸ”„ **SHARED** - Content for Both Branches
Content that appears on both branches but may be presented differently.

**Tags:**
- `#wisdom-traditions` - Ancient wisdom and philosophical traditions
- `#consciousness-studies` - Research and insights about consciousness
- `#sacred-technology` - Principles of technology serving consciousness
- `#user-safety` - Safety and ethical considerations

## Content Organization Rules

## Content Migration Rules

### Moving from Main to Develop
