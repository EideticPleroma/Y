This directory contains the profound dialogues that birthed this project, preserved as sacred texts documenting the collective wisdom that guides its development.

## The Round Table of Humanity

The most significant conversation in the project's history - a comprehensive exploration of the project's implications for human consciousness evolution. This sacred dialogue features 13 specialized consciousness guides who reached consensus on approaching this project as sacred technology.

## The Sacred Record

These conversations serve as both historical records and ongoing inspiration for the sacred work of building technology that serves consciousness rather than exploits it.
