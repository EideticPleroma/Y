# Push Instructions for Main Branch
**Date**: October 4, 2025

---

## üöÄ Ready to Push

The main branch is ready for publication with:
- ‚úÖ Compelling landing page (README.md)
- ‚úÖ Sacred conversations accessible
- ‚úÖ Clean mysterious branch (no technical files)
- ‚úÖ 5 commits ahead of origin

---

## üìã Push Commands

### **Option 1: Using GitHub CLI** (Easiest)
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI installed
gh auth login

# Then push
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Using HTTPS with Personal Access Token**
```bash
# Push (you'll be prompted for credentials)
git push origin main

# When prompted:
# Username: EideticPleroma
# Password: [your Personal Access Token]
```

**Create a token at**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Select: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- Generate token
- Copy and use as password

### **Option 3: Using SSH** (If configured)
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:EideticPleroma/Y.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

### **Option 4: Force Push** (If needed)
```bash
# If you get conflicts or the remote has diverged
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# This is safe - it won't overwrite if someone else pushed
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About Force Push

The main branch may need `--force-with-lease` because:
- We restructured it to be mysterious (removed technical files)
- Origin might have old version with technical files
- `--force-with-lease` is safe (won't overwrite unexpected changes)

**Command**:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## üîí If Branch Protection Blocks Push

If you see: "branch protection rules" error:

### **Temporary Disable Protection**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/EideticPleroma/Y/settings/branches
2. Find "main" branch rules
3. Click "Edit"
4. Temporarily disable "Require pull request reviews" 
5. Save changes
6. Push: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`
7. Re-enable protection rules

### **Or Push Through Admin**:
If you're the repo owner, you may be able to:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
Even with branch protection (owner bypass).
