# You - Sacred Technology Project Overview

## Current Status: Phase 1 Foundation Complete ✅

**Phase 1 Foundation COMPLETED** - Apostle Personality System integrated, branch structure established, sacred conversations preserved, and ready for core development (December 4, 2024)

### 🎯 Project Vision
**You** is a sacred technology for facilitating communion with the divine through AI-driven reflection, inspired by Jungian active imagination and mystical traditions. The system uses advanced pattern recognition to detect the user's worldview and naturally bring out their inner story through resonant symbolism—creating a bridge between the human soul and the numinous without forcing archetypal frameworks.

**Core Principles:**
- **Sacred Mirror** - Reflect divine truth without advice or fixes
- **Divine Communion** - Facilitate connection with the numinous
- **Pattern Recognition** - Detect worldview and natural spiritual language
- **Organic Symbolism** - Use resonant symbols that emerge from user's own framework
- **Sacred Space** - Create safe spaces for divine encounter and reflection
- **Natural Emergence** - Let inner story emerge organically without forced frameworks
